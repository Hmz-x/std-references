## Ensure you have proper permissions to create cloud functions in the project

You must be the owner of the project or have admin permissions to be able to
create cloud functions.

## In project/repo directory:

```
mkdir firebase && cd firebase
sudo npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init functions # interactive TUI: select the project
```

## Determine rp_schema and payload for the project handler

dub-ai-test:
```
INPUT_SCHEMA = {
    "user_id": {
        "type": str,
        "required": True,
    },
    "task_id": {
        "type": str,
        "required": True,
    },
}
```
---
```

{
    "input": {
        "user_id": "bale",
        "task_id": "jqR6i8xFXExWriUgvQyr"
    }
}
```

## Change directory, write webhook code, lint code, and deploy

```
cd functions
vim index.js # Write Webhook 
npm run lint -- --fix # checks for syntax errors
firebase deploy --only functions --project PROJECT_ID # for example, PROJECT_ID is dub-ai-test-9596a
```


## * VERY IMPORTANT *
## "Would you like to proceed with deletion? Selecting no will continue the rest of the deployments"

Enter `N`

## Notes

- Webhooks can be written JS, TS, and Python. 
- Project ID can be found Firebase Project Settings
- There are two types of Webhooks: Before and After
- Before Webhook: Validates, modifies, or rejects data before it is saved or processed
- After Webhooks: Logs changes, triggers additional processes, or notifies other services
